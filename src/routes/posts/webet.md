# WebET

![](/static/images/webet/viz-draft.png)

WebET is an experimental way of capturing eye tracking data from a common webcam for remote web-based usability studies. I'm working on this project over the summer as a result of an Undergraduate Research Fellowship from Carnegie Mellon University. Advised by Prof. John Zimmerman.
