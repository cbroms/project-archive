A small browser-based game where you are a packet in a network of servers trying to bring your payload to the right place. A vicious malware pursues you as you move from server to server, only you can't see it until it moves. [Play it here](https://dark-network-game.glitch.me/). 

Made with Kalpa Anjur, Vivian Noh, and Michael Poirier.
