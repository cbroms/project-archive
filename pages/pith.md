# Pith 

Pith is an experimental online discussion space that builds on the notion of an electronic direct democracy. You can read about our latest progress on the [Pith blog](https://pithblog.rainflame.com/), or get a gist of the project from [the overview post](https://pithblog.rainflame.com/posts/pith-intro). 

I'm designing and developing Pith with Sydney Zheng.
