# HCII 25th Anniversary Website

I designed a microsite for the 25th anniversary of the Human-Computer Interaction Institute at CMU. The goal was to have a place for the schedule and a short description of the event to live online. I wanted to create a poster-like design based on the HCII's logo that could be used throughout other printed and digital materials.
