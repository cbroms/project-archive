<p>This is a website I built for my parents' architecture firm FB Design. They needed a site to showcase their work with a few basic features, like the ability to filter projects. I designed a simple website that has just three page types, plus an about page.</p>
<h3>Landing Page</h3>
<p>The landing page rotates between a few images from projects, which clicking on will take you to the project page. This page is designed to immediately present a new user with projects to choose from, as opposed to a information about the firm. The idea is to put the projects before background info, which the user can choose later when they become interested by the projects they've seen.</p>
<p><a href="/static/images/fb-design/main.png"><img style='background-image: url(/static/images/fb-design/main-thumb.jpg)' data-src="/static/images/fb-design/main.png"  alt="" src="/static/images/fb-design/main-thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<h3>All Projects Page</h3>
<p>This is an index of all the available projects. They can be filtered using a dropdown, with each category being the kind of project, so that prospective clients can select just the relevant kind of projects when browsing.</p>
<p><a href="/static/images/fb-design/list.png"><img style='background-image: url(/static/images/fb-design/list-thumb.jpg)' data-src="/static/images/fb-design/list.png"  alt="" src="/static/images/fb-design/list-thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<h3>Project Pages</h3>
<p>Each project page starts with a hero image, with the project's title and a brief subtitle. I decided to create two different variations of the projcect page covers, one with a full sized image and another with an image that takes about 2/3 the width of the page. This adds some variation between the pages when browsing, so it dosen't feel too "templatey."</p>
<p><a href="/static/images/fb-design/feature.png"><img style='background-image: url(/static/images/fb-design/feature-thumb.jpg)' data-src="/static/images/fb-design/feature.png"  alt="" src="/static/images/fb-design/feature-thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Scrolling down each project page reveals more images and text describing the project. The layout varies between text and image.</p>
<p><a href="/static/images/fb-design/feature2.png"><img style='background-image: url(/static/images/fb-design/feature2-thumb.jpg)' data-src="/static/images/fb-design/feature2.png"  alt="" src="/static/images/fb-design/feature2-thumb.jpg"></a></p>
<p><a href="/static/images/fb-design/edit2.gif"><img style='background-image: url(/static/images/fb-design/edit2-thumb.jpg)' data-src="/static/images/fb-design/edit2.gif"  alt="" src="/static/images/fb-design/edit2-thumb.jpg"></a></p><div><em>This is an archived page.
