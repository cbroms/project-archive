# Projects Archive

A web archive of everything I've built. 

## Development 

The site is basic static HTML and CSS. It's built from markdown files with `compiler.py`. If you want to play around with the compiler, make sure you have the python packages `markdown` and `frontmatter` installed. 

Build the files:
```shell
python compiler.py
```

Serve the files:
```shell
python compiler.py serve 
```
